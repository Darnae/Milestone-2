Creating A Class


For this assignmnet, I was tasked with creating a class with a sucessful compilation. My screenshot show this task to be completed. I was also tasked with creating a UML model for the class, I have attached that along with .cs files of my code. My class creates an inventory, adds to it, and displays it.

I used a string named "box" to hold the items in the inventory. The description and price of the items are inlcuded.
