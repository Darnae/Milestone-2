Creating A Class


For this assignmnet, I was tasked with creating a class with a sucessful compilation. My screenshot show this task to be completed. I was also tasked with creating a UML model for the class, I have attached that along with .cs files of my code. My class creates an inventory and adds or deletes with the press of a button.
